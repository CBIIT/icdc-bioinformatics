The human genome is comprised of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that must be converted into RNA (ribonucleic acid) through a process called transcription in order to generate proteins through another process called translation. Collectively, the transcripts comprise the transcriptome and represent a collection of all the gene readouts present in a cell. RNA-Seq is a highly senstitive assay that determines the sequences of the RNA transcripts so that each one can be counted to measure the expression of each gene across the transcriptome. This can provide insight into changes occurring in disease states, in response to therapies, under different environmental conditions, and many other study designs. Additionally, RNA-Seq data enables researchers to identify transcript isoforms, gene fusions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other features. Library Preparation is the laboratory technique used to create high quality sequence-ready RNA. The first step of generating RNA-Seq data is to isolate the RNA from samples of tissue, bone, blood, tumor, etc using special laboratory kits. Once isolation is complted the quality of the total RNA must be assessed using a Bioanalyzer or a similar instrument in order to ensure the RNA is intact and of sufficient concentration for library preparation. Next the RNA will be used as an input to molecular kits that convert total RNA into a libary of template moclecules of known strand origin. The resulting mRNA is then fragmented and reverse transcribed using random primers. The cDNA product is then amplified, incorporating sequencing adapters and barcodes to create a final double-stranded cDNA library ready for sequencing.","title":"Introduction to RNA-Seq"},{"location":"Tutorials/RNA-Seq-on-CGC/rna_seq_02/#introduction-to-rna-seq","text":"RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has revolutionized the study of gene expression.

All files available through the ICDC are open-access and can be exported into the CGC by any user. For this tutorial, we will conduct an example RNA-Seq analysis using 6 Binary Alignment Mapping files derived from 6 canine individuals enrolled in the UBC02 study. 3 files are from tumor tissues sequenced from diseased individuals and 3 files are from normal tissues sequenced from healthy individuals. Info The ICDC has a comprehensive menu of faceted values that can be used to filter data by cases, sample, and files. For example, data can be filtered by the disease diagnosis, the sample pathology, or file format. Specific cases of interest can be found entering the case IDs or uploading a list of case IDs.

Info Before conducting differential expession analysis it is important to ensure the quality of the BAM files that are intended to be used as inputs. The percentage of mapped reads can have a large impact on a downstream analysis and could signal an issue with the mapping aligner that was used to generate the BAM file. Step 1: Inspect summary stats for each file with Sambamba Flagstat Click on Sambamba Flagstat Click on the Run button from the top right-hand side Click on the toggle to turn Batching On Select File from the Batch by dropdown menu Click on Input alignments Select all bam files by clicking on the respective checkboxes Click on the Save Selection button on the top right-hand side Click on the Run button on the top right-hand side Info Before conducting differential expression analysis it is important to determine which reference genome was used to generate the BAM files and how the BAM file is sorted. Step 2: Inspect bam file headers with Samtools View Click on Apps from the menu bar Click on Samtools View Click on the Run button from the top right-hand side Under App Settings scroll down to Output the header only and select True from the dropdown menu Click on the toggle to turn Batching On Select File from the Batch by dropdown menu Click on Select file(s) dropdown menu associated with the Input BAM/SAM/CRAM file Select all bam files by clicking on the respective checkboxes Click on the Save selection button on the top right-hand side Click on the Run button on the top right-hand side Info In order to count gene features across exons the HTSeq-count tool will need a Gene Transfer Format (GTF) file that contains information about each gene from a particular reference genome. In this case, the original BAM files were mapped to the NCBI reference genome canFam3. Step 3: Load the appropriate reference annotation file Download the GTF file located here https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/canFam3/bigZips/genes/ Click on canFam3.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz Locate this file on your local computer and open to unzip Navigate back to the CGC and add this file to the project Info Binary Alignment Mapping files or BAM files are simply compressed binary representation of sequence data mapped to a particular reference genome. Although these files are not human readable, we can use tools such as HTSeq to count sequencing reads that overlap exons for each gene in a reference genome. Step 4: Count sequencing reads with htseq-count Click on Apps from the secondary menu bar Click HTSeq-count Click on the Run button from the top right-hand side Under App Settings select name from the Order dropdown menu Under App Settings select ignore from the secondary alignments dropdown menu Under App Settings select ignore from the supplementary alignments dropdown menu Click on the toggle to turn Batching On Select File from the Batch by dropdown menu Click on the Select file(s) button associated with Aligned reads Select all name sorted bam files from the name_sorted folder Click on the Select file(s) button associated with Reference annotation file Select canFam3.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz Info Before conducting differential expression analysis a file must be derived to tell DESeq2 how the samples relate to one another. For this tutorial, we can easily generate this file using our exported file manifest from the ICDC. Step 5: Create a csv file with phenotype data for all samples for DESeq2 Click on Files from the menu bar In the search box type .csv and hit enter Click on the file manifest which will be named with a series of letters and numbers with a .csv file extension Click on the Download button to initiate a download to your local machine Open this file in Excel or any similar application Move the sample_id column so that it is the first column in the file Delete all rows pertaining to the Index Files with a file_format of bai Save the file as phenotype_filtered.csv The file created should be formatted similar to the file shown below Click on the Add files button to expand the dropdown menu and select Your Computer Click on the Browse files button to add the file created named phenotype_filtered.csv Click on the green Start upload button Info The DESeq2 package can determine differential expression between sample groups using the raw count table derived by HTSeq and fitting the negative binomial generalized linear model for each gene and then using the Wald test for significance testing. Count outliers are detected using Cook\u2019s distance and can be removed from further analysis. The Wald test p-values from the subset of genes that pass independent filtering can then be adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochburg procedure.
