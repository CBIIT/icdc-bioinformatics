Differential Gene Expression Analysis on the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC)
============================================

**RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)** is a high throughput technique that provides qualitative and quantitative information about RNA biology including transcriptome-wide expression quantification, discovery of novel genes and gene isoforms, and differential expression. 

The goal of this tutorial is to enable you to: 

1. Create virtual cancer cohorts using the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC). 
2. Conduct differential gene expression (DGE) within the Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), the cloud analysis platform for the ICDC.


This example RNA-Seq analysis uses 6 Binary Alignment Mapping files derived from 6 canine individuals enrolled in the UBC02 study.  3 files are from tumor tissues sequenced from diseased individuals and 3 files are from normal tissues sequenced from healthy individuals.
