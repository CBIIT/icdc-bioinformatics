Introduction to RNA-Seq
============================================

**RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)** has revolutionized the study of gene expression. The human genome is comprised of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that must be transcribed into RNA (ribonucleic acid) in order to generate proteins through a process called translation. Collectively, the transcripts comprise the transcripome and represent a collection of all the gene readouts present in a cell. RNA-Seq is a highly senstitive assay that sequences the RNA transcripts to measure the expression across the transcriptome. This can provide insight into changes occurring in disease states, in response to therapies, under different environmental conditions, and many other study designs. RNA-Seq data enables researchers to identify transcript isoforms, gene fusions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other features.
