Introduction to RNA-Seq
============================================

**RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)** has revolutionized the study of the transcriptome. This highly senstitive assay can measure the expression across the transcriptome to provide insight into changes occurring in disease states, in response to therapies, under different environmental conditions, and many other study designs. RNA-Seq data enables researchers to identify transcript isoforms, gene fusions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other features.
