Introduction to RNA-Seq
============================================

**RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)** has revolutionized the study of gene expression. The human genome is comprised of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that must be converted into RNA (ribonucleic acid) through a process called transcription in order to generate proteins through another process called translation. Collectively, the transcripts comprise the transcriptome and represent a collection of all the gene readouts present in a cell. RNA-Seq is a highly senstitive assay that determines the sequences of the RNA transcripts so that each one can be counted to measure the expression of each gene across the transcriptome. This can provide insight into changes occurring in disease states, in response to therapies, under different environmental conditions, and many other study designs. Additionally, RNA-Seq data enables researchers to identify transcript isoforms, gene fusions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other features.
